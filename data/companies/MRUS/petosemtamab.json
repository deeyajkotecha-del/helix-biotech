    "biology": {
      "simple_explanation": "Petosemtamab blocks EGFR (which drives tumor growth) while simultaneously targeting LGR5 (a marker of cancer stem cells that drive resistance and recurrence). By hitting both targets with one molecule, it attacks the tumor's growth engine AND its ability to regenerate from stem cells. This dual mechanism explains why response rates are dramatically higher than EGFR blockade alone.",

  "mechanism": {

    "how_it_works": "Petosemtamab simultaneously binds EGFR on tumor cells and LGR5 on cancer stem cells. EGFR blockade halts proliferation signaling while LGR5 targeting eliminates the treatment-resistant stem cell population responsible for recurrence. The intact Fc domain also enables ADCC — immune-mediated killing of targeted cells.",
