      "simple_explanation": "NRG1 gene fusions are rare oncogenic drivers found in ~1-2% of multiple solid tumors. The fusion creates a protein that constantly stimulates HER3, which pairs with HER2 to activate growth signaling. Zenocutuzumab is a bispecific antibody that simultaneously binds HER2 and HER3, physically preventing them from pairing up. This blocks the oncogenic signal at its source. Before BIZENGRI, patients with NRG1 fusions had no targeted therapy option.",
