      "simple_explanation": "The growth hormone receptor mediates the anabolic effects of human growth hormone on bone and cartilage. In the achondroplasia combination strategy, TransCon hGH acts as the accelerator by recruiting mesenchymal stem cells and increasing chondrocyte proliferation in the growth plate, while TransCon CNP releases the FGFR3 brake. This complementary mechanism has shown tripled efficacy versus CNP monotherapy."
