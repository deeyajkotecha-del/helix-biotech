      "simple_explanation": "The growth hormone receptor mediates the anabolic and growth-promoting effects of human growth hormone (hGH). In pediatric growth hormone deficiency, insufficient GH signaling results in short stature. SKYTROFA is a TransCon prodrug that releases hGH continuously over a week, mimicking physiological GH exposure while requiring only once-weekly injection instead of daily."
