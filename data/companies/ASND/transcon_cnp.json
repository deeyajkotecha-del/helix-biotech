      "simple_explanation": "C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) signals through the NPR-B receptor on growth plate chondrocytes, counteracting the growth-inhibiting effects of FGFR3 signaling. In achondroplasia, an overactive FGFR3 mutation acts as a brake on bone growth. TransCon CNP provides sustained CNP exposure to release this brake, restoring more normal endochondral bone growth. When combined with growth hormone (which recruits stem cells and increases chondrocyte numbers), the two complementary mechanisms can triple growth efficacy."
