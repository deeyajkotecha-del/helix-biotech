    "biology": {
      "simple_explanation": "VEGF is a signaling protein that promotes blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). In retinal diseases like wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema, excessive VEGF drives abnormal blood vessel formation and leakage in the eye, causing vision loss. Anti-VEGF therapies block this signaling. The TransCon approach aims to extend the duration of anti-VEGF activity in the eye, reducing the frequency of intravitreal injections."
