    "biology": {
      "simple_explanation": "FGF-23 is a hormone produced by osteocytes that regulates phosphate and vitamin D metabolism. In X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), excess FGF-23 causes the kidneys to waste phosphate and impairs vitamin D activation, leading to bone softening and skeletal deformities. This TransCon protein degrader is designed to reduce circulating FGF-23 levels, potentially restoring normal phosphate homeostasis."
