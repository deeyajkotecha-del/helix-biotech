    "biology": {
      "simple_explanation": "The PTH1 receptor mediates parathyroid hormone signaling that maintains calcium and phosphate homeostasis. In hypoparathyroidism, insufficient PTH leads to dangerously low calcium and elevated phosphate. YORVIPATH is a TransCon prodrug that provides continuous PTH release to restore physiological calcium regulation, replacing the need for high-dose calcium and vitamin D supplementation."
