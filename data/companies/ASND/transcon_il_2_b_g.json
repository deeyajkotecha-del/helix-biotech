      "simple_explanation": "Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine that stimulates the proliferation and activation of T cells and NK cells through the IL-2 receptor beta/gamma complex. By selectively activating the beta/gamma pathway (rather than the alpha/beta/gamma pathway that preferentially expands regulatory T cells), TransCon IL-2 beta/gamma aims to boost anti-tumor immune responses. The TransCon prodrug approach provides sustained IL-2 exposure to maintain immune activation against tumors."
