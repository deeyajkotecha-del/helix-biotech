    "name": "GLP-1 Receptor",
    "biology": {
      "simple_explanation": "The GLP-1 receptor is expressed in the pancreas, brain, and GI tract, and mediates the incretin effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 including glucose-dependent insulin secretion, appetite suppression, and delayed gastric emptying. Semaglutide is a validated GLP-1 receptor agonist already approved for diabetes and obesity. The TransCon prodrug approach aims to extend semaglutide's duration to once-monthly dosing, improving patient convenience and adherence."
