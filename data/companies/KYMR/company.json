  "description": "Kymera Therapeutics is pioneering targeted protein degradation (TPD) \nto address diseases driven by high-value, previously undruggable targets. Their platform \nuses small molecules (degraders) that can eliminate disease-causing proteins rather than \njust inhibiting them, potentially offering biologics-like efficacy in an oral pill.\n\nKey differentiators:\n- Industry leader in developing oral degrader medicines\n- Focus on historically undrugged transcription factors (STAT6, IRF5)\n- Deep expertise in target-drug interplay across tissues and cell types\n- Building a fully integrated global immunology company",
