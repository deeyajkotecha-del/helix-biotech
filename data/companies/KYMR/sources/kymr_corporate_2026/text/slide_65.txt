Target Biology and Rationale
• Regulates the G1-S transition, with its partner CCNE
                                                                                                                    CDK1
• CCNE is often overexpressed or amplified in HGSOC and CDK4/6i                  CDK1 is essential for
  resistant breast cancers, driving uncontrolled cell proliferation              all dividing cells

                                                                                                                                           G0
Genetically Validated                                                            CDK1                               M
• DEPMAP identifies CCNE1 amplification as a biomarker of                        Cyclin A
  dependency for CDK2 across cancer cell types                                               G2                                                 CDK3
• High CCNE activity is associated to resistance of CDK4/6

Advantages of MG Degraders                                                                            P        P        Rb               CDK4/6
• CDK2 inhibitors face challenges due to similarity with other                                            Rb                                   Cyclin D
  CDKs, including CDK1, causing toxicities before effective CDK2-
  pRB pathway inhibition can be achieved                                                          S
• MG degraders offer greater selectivity, and potentially broader                    CDK2
