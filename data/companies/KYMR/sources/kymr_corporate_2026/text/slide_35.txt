   Human Genetics      STAT6 is a key driver of Type 2 inflammation                              ✓
      Preclinical
                       KT-621 degraded STAT6 and blocked IL-4/13 Type 2-driven
                       inflammation in vitro/in vivo as effectively as dupilumab                 ✓
   Phase 1a Healthy
     Volunteers
                       KT-621 safely and deeply degraded STAT6, blocking IL-4/13
                       biomarkers equally or numerically better than dupilumab                   ✓
                       KT-621 safely and deeply degraded STAT6 and demonstrated
                       meaningful improvements on:
                        - Type 2 biomarkers in blood and skin
BroADen Phase 1b AD
     Patients
                        - FeNO in AD and comorbid asthma patients
                        - Clinical endpoints in patients with AD, comorbid                       ✓
                          asthma and allergic rhinitis
                       Results in line with or in some cases numerically exceeded
                       published data for dupilumab at week 4

KT-621 clinical data continues to support STAT6 degradation as a potentially transformative
approach for Type 2-driven inflammatory diseases, with a once-a-day, oral drug
