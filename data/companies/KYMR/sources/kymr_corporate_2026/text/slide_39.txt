Stimuli and Cell Specific IRF5 Activation in Clinically Validated Pathways
IRF5 degradation has the potential to selectively block inflammation and restore immune regulation by
inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines, Type I IFN and autoantibody production

                      Activation by: TLR2, -4, -5, -7, -8, -9, Dectin 1, -2                   Activation by TLR7, -8, -9

 Validation

   Blocking IRF5 activity has the potential for more effective, tolerated and durable responses in autoimmune diseases such as
                                                    SLE, Sjögren’s, RA, and IBD
