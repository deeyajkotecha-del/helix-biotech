KT-579 Reduces Joint Swelling in a Mouse Model of RA
  Treatment with KT-579 Leads to Significant Reduction in Joint       Reduction in Circulating IL-12 Levels and Infiltrating
Swelling Comparable to Tofacitinib in the AIA1 Mouse Model of RA                   Synovial IFNγ+ Th1 Cells

             Daily oral dosing of KT-579, leading to ~90% IFR5 degradation, results in significant
     reduction of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, joint swelling and pathogenic infiltrating T cells
