    KT-579 Effectively Blocks TLR Induced Pro-inflammatory Cytokines and
    Type I IFN Induction and Reduces Total IgG levels in SLE PBMC Samples

                           Pro-inflammatory Cytokines + Type I IFN                                     Total IgG

                TNFα                        IL-6                        IFNb




•    KT-579 inhibits TLR7/8 pro-inflammatory cytokines and Type I IFN that are commonly elevated in autoimmune diseases
•    KT-579 reduces TLR9 (CpG-B) induced plasmablast differentiation and inhibits IgG production in SLE derived B cells
