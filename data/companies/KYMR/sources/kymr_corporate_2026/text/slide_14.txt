 STAT6 Transcription Factor: Highly Validated but Undrugged Target
                                                                                  STAT6
                                                                         TRANSCRIPTION
• STAT6 is the specific transcription factor in the                         FACTOR

  IL-4/IL-13 pathway
                                                      Dupilumab IL-4         Dupilumab IL-4            IL-13
• IL-4/IL-13 is clinically validated by dupilumab
  across multiple Type 2 diseases:                      IL-4R⍺               γC     IL-4R⍺                     IL-13R⍺1

    • AD, asthma, COPD, EoE, CRSwNP, CSU, PN, BP

• STAT6 is genetically validated by human GoF
  and heterozygous LoF alleles

• While several therapies target the upstream IL-                                 STAT6               KT-621

  4/IL-13 receptors, there are no known drugs
  that selectively target this pathway with oral
  delivery potential
