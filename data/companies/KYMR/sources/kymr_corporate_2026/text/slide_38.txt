   Target Biology and Rationale
                                                                                      TLR Agonists
   •   IRF5 regulates pro-inflammatory cytokines, Type I IFN production and
       autoantibody production in a cell and activation-specific manner                                                               Dectin1/2
                                                                                      TLR2/4/5
   •   Targeting IRF5 has the potential to block cell-specific immune
       dysregulation while sparing normal cell function

   Genetically and Clinically Validated
                                                                                                   MyD88         TLR7/8        TLR9        SYK
   • IRF5 functional risk variants associate with increased susceptibility to SLE,

   • IRF5 regulated pathways have been clinically validated by multiple drugs        Cytosolic Receptors                 P                    Sensors

   •   Conventional approaches have failed to effectively and selectively block
                                                                                         Pro-inflammatory

   •   TPD allows for a single and specific binding event to drive depletion of
       the protein and disrupt all IRF5 signaling
                                                                                            IRF5 is a genetically validated transcription
