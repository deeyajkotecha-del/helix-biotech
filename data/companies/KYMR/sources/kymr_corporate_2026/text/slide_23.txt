                            ü Strong fidelity of translation from Phase 1a healthy volunteer study to AD patients
  STAT6 Degradation
                                                 with deep STAT6 degradation in blood and skin


  Type 2 Biomarkers           ü Robust reductions in Type 2 biomarkers in blood, skin lesions and lung (FeNO)

                          ü Meaningful improvements of clinical endpoints and patient-reported outcomes in AD,
   Clinical Endpoints
                                                 comorbid asthma and allergic rhinitis
