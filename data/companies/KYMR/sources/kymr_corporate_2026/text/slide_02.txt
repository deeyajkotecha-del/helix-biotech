Forward Looking Statements
This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. These statements include, but are
not limited to, implied and express statements about our strategy, business plans and objectives for our programs, including the therapeutic potential, clinical benefits and safety profiles of such
product candidates; expectations regarding timing, success and data announcements of ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials; the preliminary cross-study assessments comparing non-head-to-
head clinical data of KT-621 to published data for dupilumab; our ability to initiate new clinical programs, the initiation, timing, progress and results of our current and future preclinical studies and
clinical trials of our current and prospective product candidates, our plans to develop and commercialize our current and any future product candidates and the implementation of our business model
and strategic plans for our business, current; any future product candidates; and our financial condition and expected cash runway into 2029. All statements other than statements of historical facts
contained in this presentation, including express or implied statements regarding our strategy, future financial condition, future operations, projected costs, prospects, plans, objectives of
management and expected market growth, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as ‘‘anticipate,’’ “upcoming,” ‘‘assume,’’
‘‘believe,’’ ‘‘could,’’ ‘‘estimate,’’ ‘‘expect,’’ ‘‘goal,’’ ‘‘intend,’’ ‘‘may,’’ “milestones,” ‘‘objective,’’ ‘‘plan,’’ ‘‘predict,’’ ‘‘potential,’’ ‘‘seek,’’ ‘‘should,’’ ‘‘target,’’ ‘‘will,’’ ‘‘would’’ and other similar expressions that are
predictions of or indicate future events and future trends, or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed
in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events
and actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed herein.
Any forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and important factors that may cause actual events or
results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements including, without limitation, risks associated with: the timing and anticipated results of our current and
future preclinical studies and clinical trials, supply chain, strategy and future operations; the delay of any current and future preclinical studies or clinical trials or the development of our drug
candidates; the risk that the results of prior preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be predictive of future results in connection with current or future preclinical studies and clinical trials,
including those for KT-621, KT-579, KT-485/SAR447971 and CDK2 degraders; the risk that cross-trial comparisons may not be reliable as no head-to-head trials have been conducted comparing KT-
621 to dupilumab, and Phase 1 clinical data for KT-621 may not be directly comparable to dupilumab’s clinical data due to differences in molecule composition, trial protocols, dosing regimens, and
patient populations and characteristics; the risk that our strategic partnerships with Sanofi and Gilead may not be able to successfully accelerate the development and commercialization of the IRAK4
and CDK2 degrader program, respectively; our ability to successfully demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates; the timing and outcome of any interactions with regulatory
authorities; obtaining, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property; our relationships with existing and future collaboration partners; the availability of funding sufficient for the Company’s
operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements, the impacts of current macroeconomic and geopolitical events. These risks and uncertainties are described in greater detail in the section
entitled “Risk Factors” in the Company’s most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, any forward-looking
statements represent Kymera’s views only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing its views as of any subsequent date. Kymera explicitly disclaims any obligation to update any
forward-looking statements, except as required by law. No representations or warranties (expressed or implied) are made about the accuracy of any such forward-looking statements. As a result of
these risks and others, including those set forth in our filings with the SEC, actual results could vary significantly from those anticipated in this presentation, and our financial condition and results of
operations could be materially adversely affected.
Certain information contained in this presentation and statements made orally during this presentation relate to or is based on studies, publications, surveys and other data obtained from third-party
sources and the Company’s own internal estimates and research. No head-to-head trials have been conducted comparing KT-621 to dupilumab. Phase 1 clinical data for KT-621 may not be directly
comparable to dupilumab’s clinical data due to differences in molecule composition, trial protocols, dosing regimens, and patient populations and characteristics. Accordingly, cross-trial comparisons
may not be reliable. While the Company believes these third-party studies, publications, surveys and other data to be reliable as of the date of the presentation, it has not independently verified, and
makes no representation as to the adequacy, fairness, accuracy or completeness of, any information obtained from third-party sources. In addition, no independent sources have evaluated the
reasonableness or accuracy of the Company’s internal estimates or research, and no reliance should be made on any information or statements made in this presentation relating to or based on such
internal estimates and research. This presentation contains trademarks, trade names and service marks of other companies, which are the property of their respective owners.
