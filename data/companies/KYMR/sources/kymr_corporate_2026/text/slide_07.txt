Degraders Allow for Continuous, Biologics-like, Complete Pathway
Blockade Unlike Traditional Small Molecule Inhibitors (SMI)

    • Oral drugs with biologics-like activity, unlocking target classes unreachable by other modalities
    • High selectivity, strong potency, and catalytic mechanism enable full and constant target suppression with low doses
    • Achieves full pathway blockade, matching biologics-like depth of immune modulation
         Oral degraders that combine the activity of injectable biologics with the convenience of
                oral drugs have the potential to transform current treatment paradigms
