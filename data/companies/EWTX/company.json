    "core_thesis": "Edgewise is developing EDG-7500, a first-in-class selective cardiac sarcomere modulator for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Unlike approved cardiac myosin inhibitors (mavacamten, aficamten) that can cause unpredictable LVEF reductions requiring REMS programs and frequent echocardiogram monitoring, EDG-7500 preserves myosin function and has shown no meaningful LVEF reductions across its development program. Phase 2 CIRRUS-HCM data show 89% clinical improvement in oHCM and 88% in nHCM - importantly, EDG-7500 is the only sarcomere-targeting therapy being developed for nonobstructive HCM, which represents 2/3 of HCM patients and has NO approved treatments.",

      "Phase 2 CIRRUS-HCM: 89% achieved LVOT-G <30 mmHg at 100mg; 78% had ≥1 NYHA class improvement",
