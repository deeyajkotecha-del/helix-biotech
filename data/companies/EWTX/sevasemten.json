      "pathway_detail": "Fast skeletal myosin is responsible for generating force during muscle contraction. In dystrophin-deficient muscle (Becker/Duchenne), repeated contraction cycles cause progressive mechanical damage. By slowing myosin-driven contraction force, sevasemten reduces this damage.",
