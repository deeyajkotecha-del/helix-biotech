    "biology": {
      "simple_explanation": "In CKD patients on dialysis, the kidneys can no longer excrete phosphorus adequately. Hyperphosphatemia (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) is associated with vascular calcification, cardiovascular events, and increased mortality. NHE3 on the intestinal epithelium maintains tight junction permeability — inhibiting NHE3 tightens these junctions and blocks the paracellular pathway, which is the primary route of dietary phosphate absorption.",
      "pathway_detail": "NHE3 inhibition reduces intracellular sodium in enterocytes, which tightens the tight junctions between cells. This blocks the paracellular (between-cell) pathway — the primary route of passive phosphate absorption from the diet. This mechanism is fundamentally different from phosphate binders, which work by chemically binding phosphate in the gut lumen.",

        "Tightens intestinal tight junctions",
        "Blocks paracellular phosphate absorption (the primary absorption pathway)",

This is fundamentally different from phosphate binders, which work by binding phosphate in the gut lumen.",
    "why_this_approach": "Phosphate binders (sevelamer, lanthanum, calcium-based) have been the standard for decades, yet ~70% of patients on binders are unable to consistently achieve and maintain target serum phosphorus levels over a 6-month period.
