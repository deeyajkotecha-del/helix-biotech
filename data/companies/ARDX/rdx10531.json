  "target": {
    "name": "NHE3",
    "full_name": "Sodium-Hydrogen Exchanger 3",
    "class": "Ion Transporter",
    "pathway": "Intestinal sodium absorption → fluid balance, phosphate absorption, and oxalate excretion",
    "biology": {
      "simple_explanation": "NHE3 is the major sodium-absorbing transporter on the intestinal epithelium. Ardelyx has validated NHE3 as a therapeutic target across two approved products: IBSRELA (IBS-C) and XPHOZAH (hyperphosphatemia). RDX10531 is a next-generation NHE3 inhibitor designed with improved pharmacological properties — higher potency, higher solubility — to potentially address additional indications beyond the current tenapanor franchise.",
      "pathway_detail": "NHE3 sits on the brush border of enterocytes and exchanges luminal Na+ for intracellular H+. Blocking NHE3 retains sodium and water in the lumen (addressing constipation), tightens tight junctions to block paracellular phosphate absorption (addressing hyperphosphatemia), and increases intestinal oxalate excretion (potential for hyperoxaluria). RDX10531 achieves this with substantially higher potency than tenapanor.",
      "downstream_effects": [
        "Increased intestinal fluid secretion (constipation relief)",
        "Reduced paracellular phosphate absorption (hyperphosphatemia)",
        "Increased intestinal oxalate excretion (potential hyperoxaluria/kidney stone prevention)",
        "Potentially broader therapeutic applications due to improved potency and solubility"
      ]
    },
    "why_good_target": {
      "clinical_validation": "NHE3 is the most clinically validated GI ion transporter target — two approved products (IBSRELA, XPHOZAH) generating >$400M combined annual revenue prove the target works in humans across multiple indications.",
      "unmet_need": "Tenapanor patent expires Aug 2033 (IBSRELA) and Apr 2034 (XPHOZAH). A next-gen molecule with improved properties and new IP extends the franchise and potentially expands the addressable market to new indications [Corp '25 S19-20].",

    "how_it_works": "RDX10531 inhibits NHE3 on the apical surface of the intestinal epithelium, the same target as tenapanor (IBSRELA/XPHOZAH). It has been engineered with substantially higher potency and higher aqueous solubility compared to tenapanor, while maintaining the locally-acting (minimally absorbed) profile.",
    "why_this_approach": "Ardelyx has deep expertise in NHE3 biology and commercialization from tenapanor. Rather than pursuing an entirely new target, they are applying their platform knowledge to create a superior next-gen molecule that extends IP protection beyond 2033 and potentially addresses additional indications (e.g., hyperoxaluria).",
