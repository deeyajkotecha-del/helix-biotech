    "pathway": "Intestinal sodium absorption → fluid balance and phosphate-mediated visceral pain signaling",
    "biology": {
      "simple_explanation": "NHE3 is the major sodium-absorbing transporter on the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. It is responsible for absorbing the majority of ingested sodium from the GI tract. Inhibiting NHE3 reduces sodium (and consequently water) absorption, increasing fluid in the intestinal lumen. Additionally, NHE3 inhibition reduces intestinal phosphate absorption, which through a TRPV1-mediated mechanism reduces visceral pain signaling.",
      "pathway_detail": "NHE3 sits on the brush border of enterocytes and exchanges luminal Na+ for intracellular H+. Blocking NHE3 retains sodium and water in the lumen, accelerating transit. Separately, reduced phosphate absorption lowers tight junction permeability and attenuates TRPV1-mediated visceral afferent firing, reducing abdominal pain.",

    "why_previous_approaches_incomplete": {
      "challenge": "Existing IBS-C therapies (secretagogues like linaclotide, plecanatide, lubiprostone) work by stimulating fluid secretion via guanylate cyclase-C or chloride channels, but 77% of patients on these treatments continue to experience residual symptoms",
      "secretagogue_limitation": "Secretagogues only address the constipation component — they stimulate fluid secretion but do not directly address abdominal pain through a distinct mechanism",
      "nhe3_solution": "NHE3 inhibition works through a fundamentally different pathway — targeting absorption rather than secretion — and has a dual mechanism that addresses both constipation AND pain",

By blocking sodium absorption, it increases intestinal fluid secretion and accelerates transit, while also reducing visceral hypersensitivity through a phosphate-mediated mechanism. This addresses both the constipation AND the abdominal pain of IBS-C.",
    "why_this_approach": "IBSRELA is NOT a secretagogue (unlike Linzess/linaclotide and Trulance/plecanatide which stimulate chloride/fluid secretion via guanylate cyclase-C). Different MOA means it works through a distinct pathway, providing an option for the 77% of IBS-C patients who still have residual symptoms on existing therapies.",
