      "simple_explanation": "MuSK is a key protein at the connection between nerves and muscles (the neuromuscular junction). When a nerve signal arrives, MuSK helps organize the receptors on the muscle side so the signal can be received properly. In diseases like congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS), this signaling is broken — muscles don't receive nerve signals efficiently, causing weakness and fatigue. ARGX-119 acts like the natural protein agrin to activate MuSK and restore proper receptor clustering.",
      "pathway_detail": "Agrin is secreted from neurons and binds LRP4, which activates MuSK. MuSK phosphorylation recruits DOK7, which in turn recruits Rapsyn. Rapsyn causes acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) to anchor and cluster on the postsynaptic membrane, enabling neuromuscular transmission.",

Uses hIgG1-LALA backbone to diminish effector functions (no ADCC/CDC).",
    "differentiation": "Previous approaches using patient-derived MuSK antibodies bound at the wrong domain (Ig-like 1) and caused unexpected lethality in mice. Synthetic MuSK antibodies from NYU had CMC concerns and off-target binding. ARGX-119 binds at the Fz domain (like natural agrin), has no off-target binding, and behaves like agrin — the first to achieve this.",
