    "core_thesis": "Cidara developed CD388, a potentially first-in-class long-acting antiviral that achieved up to 76.1% prevention efficacy against influenza in Phase 2b. The asset addresses a massive unmet need — a single-dose, season-long flu prevention option for high-risk patients (elderly, immunocompromised) who respond poorly to vaccines. FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation, and the Phase 3 ANCHOR trial enrolled rapidly. The combination of novel mechanism, clear clinical signal, and enormous market opportunity made Cidara an irresistible acquisition target for Merck.",
