    "pathway": "Neuraminidase cleaves sialic acid on host cell receptors → enables viral release from infected cells → viral spread",
    "biology": {
      "simple_explanation": "Neuraminidase is the enzyme on the surface of influenza viruses that lets newly formed viral particles escape from infected cells to spread throughout the body. By blocking neuraminidase, CD388 traps new viruses on the cell surface, preventing infection from spreading. Unlike Tamiflu (which also blocks neuraminidase but lasts hours), CD388 conjugates the inhibitor to an antibody Fc fragment that extends its half-life to weeks — enabling single-dose, season-long protection. The Fc also recruits the immune system to destroy virus-infected cells directly.",

      "genetic_validation": {
        "gain_of_function": "Neuraminidase is essential for viral replication — all influenza strains require functional neuraminidase for spread",
        "loss_of_function": "Neuraminidase inhibitor resistance exists but is rare (<2% of circulating strains); CD388 multi-valent design provides potency advantage over monovalent inhibitors"

  "mechanism": {
    "type": "Drug-Fc Conjugate (DFC) — Cloudbreak® platform",
    "how_it_works": "CD388 conjugates a potent neuraminidase inhibitor to a human antibody Fc fragment. The small molecule component directly blocks viral neuraminidase, preventing viral release from infected cells. The Fc fragment extends half-life to weeks (enabling single-dose, season-long protection) and recruits immune-mediated clearance (ADCC) of virus-infected cells. This dual mechanism — direct antiviral + immune engagement — is unique to the DFC modality.",
    "differentiation": "Only long-acting neuraminidase inhibitor in development. Tamiflu has hours-long half-life requiring twice-daily dosing for 5 days. CD388 provides weeks of protection from a single subcutaneous injection. Fc-mediated ADCC adds immune clearance mechanism absent from conventional antivirals."
